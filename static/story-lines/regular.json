All this started with the governments digital ID card scheme. Starting in 2020, the government began to promote E-ID cards despite lacking any legal basis. The law is the government's promise to the people. At that time, the government started to promote E-ID cards without making any new promise to the public. From then till now, these systems have evolved and we've all been like frogs in slowly boiling water. <br> 在過去人們可以在網路上做一個另一個自己,而現在可以嗎?<br> 在過去沒人知道你的基因,沒人知道你的天賦和能力,在現在至少政府及其高層是知道的,對於基因給各位的限制,是否有那些疑問?<br> 在過去的網路可以自由的到各個網站瀏覽資料,通過網路跨過出生那條已經落後的起跑線,而現在無法隱藏身分的現代可以如此隨心所欲嗎?<br> 碳足跡的實施對於各位是否綁手綁腳的,政府所宣傳的透過販賣自己的碳足跡可以民眾的改善生活,事實上是如此嗎?<br> <br> 接下來就交給各位開始討論吧,除了在會場討論外,比較害羞的朋友可以掃描螢幕上的QR code,或是輸入網址在線上先進行討論,也歡迎各位來找我聊聊天"
